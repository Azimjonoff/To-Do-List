# To-Do-List

This To-Do List application was written using clean Swift and some basic Objective-C languages without any third-party libraries

# Used Tools
- Swift

Swift is the main programming language of the whole Apple Ecosystem and probably the only option to code for the devices of this company. I have used it to write the logic and control unit of my application using this language
  
- Objective-C

In some cases like declaring a function for an alert we may have to refer to basic Objective-C, the language that was used before the Swift. Some functions of Swift may have ro refer to its parent language Objective-C, thus it was important to know and to use it properly in my project

- UIKit

UIKit is a framework used within Swift to build and code User Interface of our application. Even though most of the developers suggest using SwiftUI instead of it, I find UIKit more comfortable and comprehensible than SwiftUI. 
I used UITableView to list all the Categories and Items in my UI. And TrailingSwipeAction was very handy to add a "Swipe to delete" feature

- UserDefaults

I know that it is a bit wrong to use UserDefaults to store the data of our user as it is actually designed to store very small chunks of data such as like user settings and preferences. I could have used CoreData instead of UserDefaults, but I found it way easier to use the second one
